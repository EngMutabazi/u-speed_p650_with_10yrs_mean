## Descriptions
This project is aimed in identifying the wind speed variation of ucomponent of wind on pressure level 650hpa and 925hpa. The pressure level represent the African Easterly Jet and West African Westerly Jet at 09:00 time with 10 years mean. 
<br/> 
The plots are representing monthly basis from year 1979-2020. The dataset is taken from ERA5 reanalysis as ucomponent of wind at pressure 650 and 925hpa.
